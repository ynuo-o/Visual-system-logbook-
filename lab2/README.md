# Lab2  Colour and Perception
## Part 1 - Seeing Colours and Shapes
### Task 1 - Find your blind spot
#### 1. Biological Foundation
* The Retina: The back of the eye covered in light-receptive cells (rods and cones).
* Fovea Centralis: The central region of the retina responsible for sharp, color-sensitive vision.
* The Blind Spot (Optic Disc): The specific location where the optic nerve exits the eye to carry information to the brain.
    * This area lacks photoreceptor cells, meaning it cannot detect light.

#### 2. Experimental: How to Find Your Blind Spot
**Setup**: A screen with an "O" on the left and an "X" on the right.

**Procedure**: 
* Position your nose directly in front of the X.
* Close your right eye and stare only at the X with your left eye.
* Slowly move your head closer to or further from the screen.

**Observation**: At a specific distance, the "O" will disappear from your vision.
* because its image falls exactly on the optic disc.

#### 3. The "Filling-In" Phenomenon (Brain Interpolation)
The brain hates "holes" in our vision, so it uses interpolation (filling in the gaps) to create a seamless image.
| Visual Context | What the Brain Does | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Solid Background** | Fills the blind spot with the surrounding color (e.g., making it look solid red). |
| **Geometric Lines** | Completes broken lines so they appear continuous through the blind spot. |
| **Complex Textures** | Perfectly replicates textures (like zebra stripes) to hide the missing area. |

**Key Takeaway**: What we perceive as "reality" is actually a combination of raw data from our eyes and active construction/editing by our brain. We don't see the world exactly as it is; we see a "corrected" version of it.

### Task 2 - Ishihara Colour Test

**Purpose and Mechanism**
* The Ishihara test is a color perception test for red-green color deficiencies.
* It specifically targets deficiencies in the **long-wavelength (L) cones** and **medium-wavelength (M) cones**.
* The test consists of a series of **pseudo-isochromatic plates**, which contain a circle of dots appearing randomized in color and size.

**Biological Goal**
* The test evaluates the ability to distinguish a figure (usually a number) from the background based solely on color contrast.
* Within the pattern, dots of specific hues form a number that is visible to those with normal color vision but difficult or impossible to see for those with color blindness.

**Key Metrics**
| Test Element | Targeted Deficiency | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L-cones** | Protanopia / Protanomaly | Difficulty perceiving red light. |
| **M-cones** | Deuteranopia / Deuteranomaly | Difficulty perceiving green light. |


### Task 3 - Reverse Colour

**Experimental Observation**
* **Stimulus**: Staring at a distorted American flag (e.g., cyan, black, and yellow) for an extended period.
* **Response**: Shifting gaze to a neutral white surface reveals the flag in its correct colors (red, white, and blue).

**Scientific Explanation**
1. **Photoreceptor Fatigue**: 
* When you stare at a specific color, the cone cells in your retina that are sensitive to that color become "fatigued" or overstimulated.
* This leads to a temporary decrease in their sensitivity.

2. **Opponent Process Theory**:
* Our visual system processes colors in antagonistic pairs: Red vs. Green, Blue vs. Yellow, and Black vs. White.
* While the receptors for the "funny" colors are inhibited/fatigued, the receptors for their opposing colors remain fresh and fully sensitive.

3. **Resulting Perception**:
* When looking at a white sheet (which reflects all wavelengths), the fatigued receptors fail to respond fully, while the fresh "opponent" receptors fire strongly.
* As a result, your brain perceives the complementary colors:
   * Green (distorted) → Red (afterimage)
   * Yellow (distorted) → Blue (afterimage)

**Conclusion**: Afterimages demonstrate that color perception is a dynamic process involving the balancing of opposing neural signals.

### Task 4 - Troxler's Fading 

**Experimental Observations**
* **Lilac Chaser Test**: Staring at the central black cross causes the rotating gap to appear as a green moving spot. Eventually, the surrounding magenta spots disappear entirely, leaving only a grey background.
* **Fading Experiment**: Staring at a central red dot causes the surrounding fuzzy blue/grey ring to gradually fade and blend into the white background.

**Scientific Explanation**
1. **Neural Adaptation (The Core Reason)**:
* Our sensory system is designed to detect changes rather than constants. 
* When a stimulus in the peripheral vision remains unchanging (stationary and blurred), the neurons responsible for perceiving it stop firing after a few seconds.
* This is a "filtering" mechanism that prevents the brain from being overwhelmed by non-essential, constant information.

2. **The "Green" Spot (Afterimage Connection)**:
* Similar to Task 3, as the magenta/lilac spots fatigue the receptors, the brain perceives the opponent color (Green) in the empty space where the spot just was.

3. **Relationship to the Visual System**:
* Troxler’s fading highlights that our brain constantly "ignores" stable images on our retina (like the shadows of blood vessels inside the eye). 
* Small, involuntary eye movements (microsaccades) usually prevent this fading in daily life by shifting the image slightly across different photoreceptors.

**Conclusion**: Troxler's fading proves that perception is heavily dependent on change. If a visual signal is constant and lacks sharp edges, the brain eventually "deletes" it from our conscious awareness.

### Task 5 - Brain sees what it expects (Visual Illusions)

**Experiment 1: Shepard Tables (Size Perception)**

**Observation**: The blue table appears to be long and thin, while the red table appears to be shorter and more square. However, measuring them reveals the tabletops are identical in size and shape.

**Scientific Explanation**:
* Perspective Cues: Our brain interprets the 2D image as 3D objects. 
* The vertical orientation of the blue table suggests depth, making the brain "compensate" by perceiving it as longer. 
* This is known as Size Constancy —the brain adjusts the perceived size based on the perceived distance and angle.

**Experiment 2: Checker Shadow Illusion (Brightness Perception)**

**Observation**: Square A looks significantly darker than Square B. In reality, both squares are the exact same shade of grey.

**Scientific Explanation**:
* Shadow Compensation: The brain identifies that Square B is in the shadow of the green cylinder.
* Local Contrast vs. Global Expectation: 
  * The brain knows that Square B is part of a "white" checkerboard pattern.
  * It automatically "filters out" the shadow to determine what the actual surface color *should* be.
  * Consequently, the brain perceives B as lighter than it actually is to compensate for the darkness of the shadow.

**Conclusion**: These tasks demonstrate that the brain is not a passive receiver of light; it is an active interpreter. It prioritizes "making sense" of the world (depth, shadow, object constancy) over literal accuracy.
