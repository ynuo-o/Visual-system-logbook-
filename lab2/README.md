# Lab2  Colour and Perception
## Part 1 - Seeing Colours and Shapes
### Task 1 - Find your blind spot
#### 1. Biological Foundation
* The Retina: The back of the eye covered in light-receptive cells (rods and cones).
* Fovea Centralis: The central region of the retina responsible for sharp, color-sensitive vision.
* The Blind Spot (Optic Disc): The specific location where the optic nerve exits the eye to carry information to the brain.
    * This area lacks photoreceptor cells, meaning it cannot detect light.

#### 2. Experimental: How to Find Your Blind Spot
**Setup**: A screen with an "O" on the left and an "X" on the right.

**Procedure**: 
* Position your nose directly in front of the X.
* Close your right eye and stare only at the X with your left eye.
* Slowly move your head closer to or further from the screen.

**Observation**: At a specific distance, the "O" will disappear from your vision.
* because its image falls exactly on the optic disc.

#### 3. The "Filling-In" Phenomenon (Brain Interpolation)
The brain hates "holes" in our vision, so it uses interpolation (filling in the gaps) to create a seamless image.
| Scenario | Input Pattern | Resulting Perception |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Solid Background** | Solid red background with a dot. | The dot disappears and is replaced by a solid red surface. |
| **Geometric Lines** | Two intersecting lines. | The brain completes the broken lines, showing a perfect cross. |
| **Complex Textures** | Blue and black zebra stripes. | The brain reconstructs the stripe pattern across the blind spot. |
