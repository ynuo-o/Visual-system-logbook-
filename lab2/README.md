# Lab2  Colour and Perception
## Part 1 - Seeing Colours and Shapes
### Task 1 - Find your blind spot
#### 1. Biological Foundation
* The Retina: The back of the eye covered in light-receptive cells (rods and cones).
* Fovea Centralis: The central region of the retina responsible for sharp, color-sensitive vision.
* The Blind Spot (Optic Disc): The specific location where the optic nerve exits the eye to carry information to the brain.
    * This area lacks photoreceptor cells, meaning it cannot detect light.

#### 2. Experimental: How to Find Your Blind Spot
**Setup**: A screen with an "O" on the left and an "X" on the right.

**Procedure**: 
* Position your nose directly in front of the X.
* Close your right eye and stare only at the X with your left eye.
* Slowly move your head closer to or further from the screen.

**Observation**: At a specific distance, the "O" will disappear from your vision.
* because its image falls exactly on the optic disc.

#### 3. The "Filling-In" Phenomenon (Brain Interpolation)
The brain hates "holes" in our vision, so it uses interpolation (filling in the gaps) to create a seamless image.
| Visual Context | What the Brain Does | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| **Solid Background** | Fills the blind spot with the surrounding color (e.g., making it look solid red). |
| **Geometric Lines** | Completes broken lines so they appear continuous through the blind spot. |
| **Complex Textures** | Perfectly replicates textures (like zebra stripes) to hide the missing area. |

**Key Takeaway**: What we perceive as "reality" is actually a combination of raw data from our eyes and active construction/editing by our brain. We don't see the world exactly as it is; we see a "corrected" version of it.

### Task 2 - Ishihara Colour Test

**Purpose and Mechanism**
* The Ishihara test is a color perception test for red-green color deficiencies.
* It specifically targets deficiencies in the **long-wavelength (L) cones** and **medium-wavelength (M) cones**.
* The test consists of a series of **pseudo-isochromatic plates**, which contain a circle of dots appearing randomized in color and size.

**Biological Goal**
* The test evaluates the ability to distinguish a figure (usually a number) from the background based solely on color contrast.
* Within the pattern, dots of specific hues form a number that is visible to those with normal color vision but difficult or impossible to see for those with color blindness.

**Key Metrics**
| Test Element | Targeted Deficiency | Clinical Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L-cones** | Protanopia / Protanomaly | Difficulty perceiving red light. |
| **M-cones** | Deuteranopia / Deuteranomaly | Difficulty perceiving green light. |


### Task 3 - Reverse Colour

**Experimental Observation**
* **Stimulus**: Staring at a distorted American flag (e.g., cyan, black, and yellow) for an extended period.
* **Response**: Shifting gaze to a neutral white surface reveals the flag in its correct colors (red, white, and blue).

**Scientific Explanation**
1. **Photoreceptor Fatigue**: 
* When you stare at a specific color, the cone cells in your retina that are sensitive to that color become "fatigued" or overstimulated.
* This leads to a temporary decrease in their sensitivity.

2. **Opponent Process Theory**:
* Our visual system processes colors in antagonistic pairs: Red vs. Green, Blue vs. Yellow, and Black vs. White.
* While the receptors for the "funny" colors are inhibited/fatigued, the receptors for their opposing colors remain fresh and fully sensitive.

3. **Resulting Perception**:
* When looking at a white sheet (which reflects all wavelengths), the fatigued receptors fail to respond fully, while the fresh "opponent" receptors fire strongly.
* As a result, your brain perceives the complementary colors:
   * Green (distorted) → Red (afterimage)
   * Yellow (distorted) → Blue (afterimage)

**Conclusion**: Afterimages demonstrate that color perception is a dynamic process involving the balancing of opposing neural signals.

### Task 4 - Troxler's Fading 

**Experimental Observations**
* **Lilac Chaser Test**: Staring at the central black cross causes the rotating gap to appear as a green moving spot. Eventually, the surrounding magenta spots disappear entirely, leaving only a grey background.
* **Fading Experiment**: Staring at a central red dot causes the surrounding fuzzy blue/grey ring to gradually fade and blend into the white background.

**Scientific Explanation**
1. **Neural Adaptation (The Core Reason)**:
* Our sensory system is designed to detect changes rather than constants. 
* When a stimulus in the peripheral vision remains unchanging (stationary and blurred), the neurons responsible for perceiving it stop firing after a few seconds.
* This is a "filtering" mechanism that prevents the brain from being overwhelmed by non-essential, constant information.

2. **The "Green" Spot (Afterimage Connection)**:
* Similar to Task 3, as the magenta/lilac spots fatigue the receptors, the brain perceives the opponent color (Green) in the empty space where the spot just was.

3. **Relationship to the Visual System**:
* Troxler’s fading highlights that our brain constantly "ignores" stable images on our retina (like the shadows of blood vessels inside the eye). 
* Small, involuntary eye movements (microsaccades) usually prevent this fading in daily life by shifting the image slightly across different photoreceptors.

**Conclusion**: Troxler's fading proves that perception is heavily dependent on change. If a visual signal is constant and lacks sharp edges, the brain eventually "deletes" it from our conscious awareness.
